Baiting drive impacts doesn't cut it anymore because people don't drive impact a lot at master rank.

Just checking a few drive rushes slowed down my opponents significantly

People now generally know when they are minus and tech a lot more, shimmies are getting a lot of mileage.

My opponents didn't actually drive rush a lot, but being ready and knowing I can check it allowed me to slow down and play footsies with more confidence.

Being so focused on checking drive rush also allowed me to play with a lot of intensity and be less tilted, but I really don't think I can keep up the intensity that long at least for now.

The few whiff punishes and spacing traps I did get me most of my damage.

The spacing trap were accidental or instinct, I have to lab them and become more cognisant when I was use them.

I got some whiff punishes if when I focus on these I'll definitely see a big gain in performance.

I was burning out a lot because I confirm my 2Mp whiff punishes with a DR cancel instead of level 1, this need to be corrected ASAP.

I lost a lot of plus situation when using drill, at least I think I was plus, I need to get these timings down.

## How I can improve from here

- Drill whiff punishing 2Mp into level 1
- Keep doing drive rush drill checks
- Add the dashback 1Hp shimmies from +3 situations into my game
- Look at the 2 replays for the time where I had potential spacing traps
- look at the replays for times I was plus +3 and could've dashed back shimmied.
